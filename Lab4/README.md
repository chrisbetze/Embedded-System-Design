# High-Level Synthesis for FPGA

## Description
The purpose of this exercise is to study High Level Synthesis (HLS) for FPGA programming. 
It is about optimizing and accelerating C code to run on hardware of **Xilinx Zybo FPGA**.

## Application
The application studied for optimization is related to neural networks and in particular **Generative Adversarial Networks** (GANs). 
Specifically, the application is about the reconstruction of unfinished images from handwritten digits ([MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)). 
The ultimate goal is to accelerate this algorithm in relation to the software implementation, but also to measure the image reconstruction quality.
